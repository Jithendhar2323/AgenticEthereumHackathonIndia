## 📌 Problem Statement

We addressed the challenge: *SkillAgent.AI : AI-powered decentralized career mentor*  
-> Lost in Learning
-> Most students are confused about what to learn, where to start, and how to prove what they’ve learned.
* They struggle to align their interests with a clear career path.
*Rapid tech changes make learning decisions harder.
*Degrees rarely match real job skills.
*Companies spend months retraining fresh hires.
*Resumes are often exaggerated or unverifiable.


## 💡 Our Solution

*Project Name:* SkillAgent.AI : AI-powered decentralized career mentor* 
**SkillAgent.AI Overview**
We built SkillAgent.AI — a decentralized, AI-powered career mentor designed to fix the broken education-to-employment system.

**What SkillAgent.AI Does:**

* Powered by Agentic AI to create personalized learning paths based on individual interests, strengths, and market trends.
* Tracks real-time learning progress to ensure students stay on the right path.
* Uses Ethereum NFTs to verify and store skill achievements in a transparent and tamper-proof manner.
* Helps recruiters find verified, job-ready candidates based on proven skills rather than traditional resumes.
* Acts as a bridge between students, skills, and recruiters, fostering a trust-based, skill-first ecosystem.

**Vision**
To transform every student into a confident, job-ready candidate through interest-based AI guidance and on-chain skill verification — ensuring that education directly leads to meaningful careers.
